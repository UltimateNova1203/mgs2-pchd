.XTI Textures
	Need more info for this type. Uses HEX named subtextures in a bigger texture map. Textures are made up of .DDS textures. Has full size resolution information but somehow further compresses data by cropping out non-used areas.
	
.DDS Textures
	Each main texture in the .XTI file is a .DDS DXT5 texture with interpolated alpha.
	
.DDS Cropping
	By cropping textures (seems to be either 24x or 32x pixel blocks) in height, you can shave size off the texture.
